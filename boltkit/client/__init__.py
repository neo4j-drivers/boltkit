How To Build a Neo4j Connector
******************************

Welcome to our simple guide to how to build a Bolt connector for Neo4j. This
file is intended to be read from top to bottom, giving an incremental
description of the pieces required to construct a simple connector from scratch
in any language.

While this connector implementation forms part of our suite of testing tools,
it also gives a great opportunity to illustrate the structure of a connector.
This is due to the inherent readability of Python source code as well as
Python's comprehensive standard library and the fact that minimal boilerplate
is required.

Note that while this connector is complete, it is neither supported, nor
intended for use in a production environment. You can of course decide to
ignore this and do so anyway but if you do, you're on your own!

So, let's get started.

Neo4j provides a binary protocol, called Bolt, which is what we are actually
targeting here. A Bolt connector will typically implement two layers of the
OSI network model:

Presentation Layer:
   For this, we use a custom serialisation format called PackStream. While the
   design of this format is inspired heavily by MessagePack, it is not
   compatible with it. PackStream provides a type system that is fully
   compatible with the Cypher type system used by Neo4j and also takes
   extension data types in a different direction to MessagePack. The PackStream
   implementation can be found in the separate `packstream` module.

Application Layer:
   At its heart, the Bolt protocol provides a stateful request-response
   mechanism. Each request consists of a textual statement plus a map or dictionary of
   parameters; each response is comprised of a stream of content plus some summary metadata.
   Message pipelining comes for free: a Bolt server will queue requests and respond to them in
   the same order in which they were received. A Bolt client therefore has a degree of
   flexibility in how and when it sends requests and how and when it gathers the responses.

# You'll need to make sure you have the following items handy...
from logging import getLogger
from socket import socket, AF_INET, AF_INET6
from struct import pack as raw_pack, unpack_from as raw_unpack
from time import perf_counter, sleep

# ...and we'll borrow some things from other modules
from boltkit.addressing import AddressList
from boltkit.client.packstream import UINT_16, UINT_32, Structure, pack, unpack


# CHAPTER 2: CONNECTIONS
# ======================
# It's here that we get properly into the protocol. A Bolt connection operates under a
# client-server model whereby a client sends requests to a server and the server responds
# accordingly. There is no mechanism for a server to send a message at any other time, nor should
# client software receive data when no message is expected.

# The Handshake
# -------------
# On successfully establishing a TCP connection to a listening server, the client should send a
# fixed sequence of four bytes in order to declare to the server that it intends to speak Bolt.
#
# Fun fact: the four "magic" bytes are supposed to spell "GO GO BOLT!" when written in hex and
# read through squinted eyes. Other hilarious phrases were considered and rejected.
#
BOLT = b"\x60\x60\xB0\x17"

# After the protocol announcement comes version negotiation. The client proposes to the server up
# to four protocol versions that it is able to support in order of preference. Each protocol
# version is a 32-bit unsigned integer and zeroes are used to fill the gaps if the client knows
# fewer than four versions.
#
# In response, the server replies with a single version number on which it agrees. If for some
# reason it can't agree, it returns a zero and disconnects immediately.
#
# Now that you've read and absorbed all that, push it to the back of your brain. As there currently
# exists only one version of Bolt, the negotiation turns out to be far more simple than that. The
# server and client send the following to each other:
#
#   C: 00:00:00:01 00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00
#   S: 00:00:00:01
#
# And that's it. If the server responds with anything else, hang up and get in touch. We may have a
# problem.
#

# Messaging
# ---------
# Once we've negotiated the (one and only) protocol version, we fall into the regular protocol
# exchange. This consists of request and response messages, each of which is serialised as a
# PackStream structure with a unique tag byte.
#
# The client sends messages from the selection below:
CLIENT = {}
CLIENT[(1, 0)] = {
    "INIT": 0x01,           # INIT <user_agent> <auth_token>
                            # -> SUCCESS - connection initialised
                            # -> FAILURE - init failed, disconnect (reconnect to retry)
                            #
                            # Initialisation is carried out once per connection, immediately
                            # after version negotiation. Before this, no other messages may
                            # validly be exchanged. INIT bundles with it two pieces of data:
                            # a user agent string and a map of auth information. More detail on
                            # on this can be found in the ConnectionSettings class below.

                            #
                            # When a FAILURE occurs, no further actions may be carried out
                            # until that failure has been acknowledged by the client. This
                            # is a safety mechanism to prevent actions from being carried out
                            # by the server when several requests have been optimistically sent
