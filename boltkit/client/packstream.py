This module implements PackStream: the data serialisation format used by Bolt.

PackStream is a custom serialisation format which is inspired heavily by
MessagePack, but is not compatible with it. This format provides a type
system that is fully compatible with the Cypher type system used by
Neo4j and also allows for extension data types via the `Structure` mechanism.
"""

# You'll need to make sure you have the following items handy...
from struct import pack as raw_pack, unpack_from as raw_unpack


# Python provides a module called `struct` for coercing data to and from binary
# representations of that data. The format codes below are the ones that
# PackStream cares about and each has been given a handy name to make the code
# that uses it easier to follow. The second character in each of these codes
# (the letter) represents the actual data type, the first character (the '>'
# symbol) denotes that all our representations should be big-endian. This means
# that the most significant part of the value is written to the network or
# memory space first and the least significant part is written last. PackStream
# thinks entirely in big ends.
#
INT_8 = ">b"        # signed 8-bit integer (two's complement)
INT_16 = ">h"       # signed 16-bit integer (two's complement)
INT_32 = ">i"       # signed 32-bit integer (two's complement)
INT_64 = ">q"       # signed 64-bit integer (two's complement)
UINT_8 = ">B"       # unsigned 8-bit integer
UINT_16 = ">H"      # unsigned 16-bit integer
UINT_32 = ">I"      # unsigned 32-bit integer
FLOAT_64 = ">d"     # IEEE double-precision floating-point format


# The PackStream type system supports a set of commonly-used data types (plus
# null) as well as extension types called "structures" that can be used to
# represent composite values. The full list of types is:
#
#   - Null (absence of value)
#   - Boolean (true or false)
#   - Integer (signed 64-bit integer)
#   - Float (64-bit floating point number)
#   - String (UTF-8 encoded text data)
#   - Bytes (Arrays of raw byte data)
#   - List (ordered collection of values)
#   - Dictionary (ordered, keyed collection of values)
#   - Structure (composite set of values with a type tag)
#
# Neither unsigned integers nor byte arrays are supported but may be added in a
# future version of the format. Note that 32-bit floating point numbers are
# also not supported.


# Oh, by the way, we use hexadecimal a lot here. If you're not familiar with
# that, you might want to take a short break and hop over to Wikipedia to read
# up about it before going much further...

    """ The `Structure` data type is used to represent composite values. Each

        self.tag = tag
        self.fields = fields

def pack(*values):
    """ This function provides PackStream values-to-bytes functionality, a
    process known as "packing". The tag of the method permits any number of
    values to be provided as positional arguments. Each will be serialised in
    order into the output byte stream.

    Markers
    -------
    Every serialised value begins with a marker byte. The marker contains
    information on data type as well as direct or indirect size information
    for those types that require it. How that size information is encoded
    varies by marker type.

    Some values, such as boolean true, can be encoded within a single marker
    byte. Many small integers (specifically between -16 and +127 inclusive)
    are also encoded within a single byte.

    A number of marker bytes are reserved for future expansion of the format
    itself. These bytes should not be used, and encountering them in an
    incoming stream should treated as an error.

    Sized Values
    ------------
    Some value types require variable length representations and, as such,
    have their size explicitly encoded. These values generally begin with a
    single marker byte, followed by a size, followed by the data content
    itself. Here, the marker denotes both type and scale and therefore
    determines the number of bytes used to represent the size of the data. The
    size itself is either an 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit unsigned integer. Sizes
    longer than this are not yet supported.

    The diagram below illustrates the general layout for a sized value, here
    with a 16-bit size:

      Marker Size          Content
        <>  <--->  <--------------------->
        XX  XX XX  XX XX XX XX .. .. .. XX

    Returns:
        Byte representation of values.

    # Next we'll iterate through the values in turn and add the output to our
    # collection of byte pieces.

        # Integers
        # --------
        # Integer values occupy either 1, 2, 3, 5 or 9 bytes depending on
        # magnitude. Several markers are designated specifically as TINY_INT
        # values and can therefore be used to pass a small number in a single
        # byte. These markers can be identified by a zero high-order bit (for
        # positive values) or by a high-order nibble containing only ones (for
        # negative values). The available encodings are illustrated below and
        # each shows a valid  representation for the decimal value 42:
        #
        #     2A                          -- TINY_INT
        #     C8:2A                       -- INT_8

        # Structures
        # ----------
        # Structures represent composite values and consist, beyond the marker,
        # of a single byte tag followed by a sequence of fields, each an
        # individual value. The size of a structure is measured as the number
        # of fields and not the total byte size. This count does not include
        # the tag. The markers used to denote a structure are described in
        # the table below:
        #
        #   Marker | Size                               | Maximum size
        #  ========|====================================|===============
        #   B0..BF | within low-order nibble of marker  | 15 fields
        #   DC     | 8-bit big-endian unsigned integer  | 255 fields
        #   DD     | 16-bit big-endian unsigned integer | 65 535 fields
        #
        # The tag byte is used to identify the type or class of the structure.
        # Tag bytes may hold any value between 0 and +127. Bytes with the high
        # bit set are reserved for future expansion. For structures containing
        # fewer than 16 fields, the marker byte should contain the high-order
        # nibble 'B' (binary 1011) followed by a low-order nibble containing
        # the size. The marker is immediately followed by the tag byte and the
        # field values.
        #
        # For structures containing 16 fields or more, the marker DC or DD
        # should be used, depending on scale. This marker is followed by the
        # size, the tag byte and the fields, serialised in order. Examples
        # follow below:
        #
        #     B3 01 01 02 03  -- Struct(sig=0x01, fields=[1,2,3])
        #     DC 10 7F 01  02 03 04 05  06 07 08 09  00 01 02 03
        #     04 05 06  -- Struct(sig=0x7F, fields=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
