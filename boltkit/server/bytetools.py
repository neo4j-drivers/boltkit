def h(data):
    """ A small helper function to translate byte data into a human-readable hexadecimal
    representation. Each byte in the input data is converted into a two-character hexadecimal
    string and is joined to its neighbours with a colon character.

    This function is not essential to driver-building but is a great help when debugging,
    logging and writing doctests.

        >>> from boltkit.bytetools import h
        >>> h(b"\x03A~")
        '03:41:7E'

    Args:
        data: Input byte data as `bytes` or a `bytearray`.

    Returns:
        A textual representation of the input data.
    """
    return ":".join("{:02X}".format(b) for b in bytearray(data))
